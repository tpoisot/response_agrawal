Dear Dr. Brink,

We would like to submit a short letter to *Trends in Plant Science*, commenting
on a recent paper published in your journal (Agrawal, A. 2014. Four more
reasons to be skeptical of open-access publishing). We do not think that
the opinion presented in this letter (i) is representative of the reality
of the open-access movement in any way, and (ii) represents a constructive
discussion of the merits of OA as opposed to subscription-based publishing.

Specifically, we make the point that claiming that OA is detrimental to the
career prospects of early career scientists is fear mongering. We bring several
additional references, directly contradicting the opinions and facts expressed
by Agrawal, that show how publishing in OA-journals has immediate benefits.

Importantly, Agrawal exhorts scientists to find a publication model that
serves their primary goal. We question whether this primary goal is the
maximization of measures of impact, or the efficient dissemination of
scientific information. We feel that this response represents a fair but
important counter-balance to the arguments brought forth by Agrawal. A
community-wide discussion of the merits of OA is much needed, and we hope
that by publishing ouur contribution, you will play your part in making this
debate happen.

Yours,
T. Poisot & K. Ram
