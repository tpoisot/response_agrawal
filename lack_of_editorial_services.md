# Some thoughts on this:

1. Except for really journals at the far end of the impact spectrum, journals (regardless of open access status) rarely offer copy editing services [citation]. Even journals that only test for scientific rgior, e.g. the PLOS family, still require figures to conform to strict guidelines.

2. Some notes on integration with figshare that's happening with oa and non-oa journals and how this is slowly becoming a non-issue.

A quick table with requirements for both. Again, if the table is too long, we can cull it down to representative journals.
